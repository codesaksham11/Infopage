    <h1>Mental Health 🧠</h1>
    <div class="content-box">
        <p>My mental abilities aren’t the strongest these days. 😕 Back in my early school years, though, I did quite well—I even topped my class in third grade and LKG, which felt amazing! 🌟✨ But after that, I never reached first place again. 🥺 It’s not just studies either; I find extra activities and real-life situations tricky too. ⚽📚</p>
        <p>I was encouraged to focus only on books growing up—no time for playing outside or hanging out with friends. 📖 So, I’ve gathered a lot of knowledge from reading, but not much from life. 🌳 If you ask me how to behave when a cousin visits, I’d struggle to answer. 😅 But if you ask what the study of the liver is called, I’d say “hepatology” without hesitation! 🎯</p>
        <p>There’s a saying, “You are what you train for,” and it fits me well. ✅ To some, I might seem a little lost because I haven’t had much practice with everyday things—like talking to an aunt. I just don’t have the experience yet. </p>
