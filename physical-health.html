    <h1>Physical Health 💪</h1>
    <div class="content-box">
        <p>When it comes to physical health, I'm pretty average. 😐 Nothing special, just okay! 👍 I've never stepped foot in a gym, but I've got big plans—I will join after 12th grade. 🏋️‍♂️ For now, I can lift up to 30kg—that’s my max, and I am not  proud of it! 💪😊 Still, I am not exactly active. Most of my day is a sit-and-chill kinda deal. 🛋️</p>
        <p>School’s a long haul—two hours to get there, two hours back. 🚍 Four hours total, just stuck on a ride, listening to songs and zoning out. 🎶✨ Nothing else to do! 🙃 Then, there’s seven hours at school—poof, gone. ⏰ Back home, I've got about four hours left (not counting sleep). 😴 What’s that time for? Homework, some fun, and—you guessed it—scrolling on my phone. 📱 Every day, same routine! 🔄</p>
