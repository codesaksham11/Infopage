                <h2>1. The Downward Spiral: 10th Grade</h2>
                <p>
                    Everything until 10th grade was normal, like a normal being. That's where the real downs started.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I had just learned that the sun emits UV and that UV causes skin damage. So I started avoiding it. What I didn't know was that the sun also regulates mood and hormones. Days passed with no sun exposure, and since it was class 10, I was mostly by myself, alone, studying.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I wasn't allowed to play games (a classic 10th-grade pressure). No games meant no contact with friends.
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    No sun exposure + Loneliness = A problem called Limerence. It makes you obsessed with someone, compelling you to make efforts you otherwise wouldn't. In simpler terms, my behavior became erratic and irrational.
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    If you know me now and had met me back then, you would say they are two totally different people. It was so bad that I had to change my school in the middle of 10th grade because of how stupidly I was behaving. I'm going to be honest: I have all the memories of those days, and I can tell you for sure my behavior was no different than that of a mentally disabled kid or one with Down syndrome.

                <h2>2. The Turnaround: A New Beginning</h2>
                <p>
                    Anyway, school changed. New people, new experiences, new teachers, a new route to school... and finally, I was talking to people and going out in the sun again.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Life changed from that point. Grade 10 ended, and I was in a bridge course. I had changed so much that you wouldn't believe it, but I had a good friend circle, a girlfriend, and a girl from class who had a crush on me (my friends told me). We used to play Mini Militia all day.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And of course, how could I forget Bimal sir. He was the zoology teacher at my bridge course institute, and I was his favorite student. Life was so great. Bimal sir helped me a lot, and because of him—even though I played games in every other class except his—I cracked the entrances for Kalika (Butwal's best college), Tilottama, and Horizon. Not only that, but I somehow got a full scholarship to Rammani and started studying there.

                <h2>3. The Present Haunting</h2>
                <p>
                    If you are reading this, I am in class 12 or have just passed it (because after that, this website won't exist). The core reason I am sharing such sensitive info on a site like this is because I have no friends. Having deep things bottled up without sharing them with anyone feels like a mental breakdown. It has to go somewhere, and the internet is my only friend.
                </p>
                <p>
                    11th grade started well. New friends, a new college—everything was exciting. Except, I have always wanted to bury that 10th-grade experience like it never happened, because it didn't even feel like me at the time. But here, some old mates from my 10th-grade school are in the same major. When you want to leave your past behind and there are people constantly reminding you of it, it feels unbearably annoying. I truly hate them. I don't want anything reminding me of that dark piece of my life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Slowly, 11th grade started haunting me. "What if they get to know who I was? What if they knew I misbehaved with a girl?" These are the questions that trigger my brain. It didn't happen during the bridge course, but since those two people are here, it just makes me want to leave this college as soon as possible. I'm not kidding; I've played cards in class just to make sure I don't get distracted by those thoughts again (yes teachers teaching couldn't do that so...)
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    Let me give you my perspective: You're in college, with new friends and everything new. You even have a crush (c'mon, everyone has one). But then you're afraid to even look at her. Why? Because one of the motherfuckers from 10th grade is a mutual friend to everybody in the class and flirts with whoever he gets a chance with. So no, I don't have the courage to talk with new friends, especially girls and my crush, because it's a 50-50 chance that dude has already told the whole class I once misbehaved with a girl.
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    This isn't me. I don't want that stigma to follow me around. But it is, because of those two guys. Half of my college life was just spent thinking, "What if they know I misbehaved? What if they judge me?"
                </p>
                <p>
                    That's it. From the day I'm writing this, it's 8 months until my farewell. Once farewell is done, I hope I can actually start being me. And I hope those two won't be there. I'm not rude; You have done nothing bad for me, but I hate you, Khatris. (I know I'm stupid for this).
