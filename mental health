        <p>I’m not super sharp these days, mentally speaking. But rewind to the early years—I was a total star! 🌟 Topped my class in third grade and even LKG. Pretty cool, huh? After that, though? Never snagged first place again. 🥹</p>
        <p>It’s not just school either—real life and extra stuff trip me up too. I was basically forced to study 24/7. No playing outside, no fun with friends—just books, books, books. So, I’m loaded with facts but clueless about life. Ask me how to act when your cousin visits? Blank stare. 😅 Ask me what the study of the liver is? Boom—“hepatology!” I’ve got that locked down! 😉</p>
        <p>They say, “You are what you train for,” and that’s me in a nutshell. To most, I might seem a bit… lost. Give me a simple task like chatting with your aunt? I’m stumped—what do I say? No clue, no practice! 😌</p>
